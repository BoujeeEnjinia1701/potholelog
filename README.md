**Area:** Smart Cities · **TRL:** 2 of 9 (concept formulated) · **Prototype budget:** about $70 USD · **Difficulty:** 2 of 5

A vehicle-mounted road roughness logger for buses, garbage trucks or bikes that records vibration with location to map potholes and rough roads as the fleet drives its routes.

## Concept rationale

Fleets already cover the network every week; a small sensor turns routine trips into a road survey.

## Burning platform

Road maintenance backlogs are large in many cities, and poor roads damage vehicles and endanger cyclists.

## Where it could be used

### By industry

| Industry | Use |
| --- | --- |
| _To be developed_ | |

### By country or region

| Country or region | Why it matters there |
| --- | --- |
| _To be developed_ | |

## What sparked the idea

It came out of a September 2026 review of Design Molecule's applied research areas against the open projects already in the lab.

## Problem

Road surveys are expensive and infrequent, so repairs follow complaints rather than condition.

## Concept

A vehicle-mounted road roughness logger for buses, garbage trucks or bikes that records vibration with location to map potholes and rough roads as the fleet drives its routes.

Full design precis: [docs/02-concept.md](docs/02-concept.md)

## Key components

- Accelerometer and GNSS module
- Microcontroller with storage and cellular upload
- Vehicle power adapter
- Rugged mount

The working bill of materials is in [bom/bom.csv](bom/bom.csv).

## Safety

> Mount securely so nothing can detach in traffic, and never interact with the device while driving.

## Documentation

Controlled documents follow the portfolio [documentation standard](.kit/STANDARDS.md). Each carries a document ID (PHL-PRC-001 for the precis), a version and a revision history. Branded PDFs are built with `python .kit/render.py` and attached to GitHub Releases when a document is tagged, for example `PHL-PRC-001/v1.0`.
